This repository contains code to sonify astronomical images using Python.

In ‘Initial image loading and pixel extraction script’ we loaded a galaxy image from a .npy dataset using NumPy. The pixel data of the image was collected by iterating over each pixel to extract its RGB values, which were then saved in a structured format (CSV file) with row, column, and RGB components. Finally, we visualized the image and its pixel structure using matplotlib.
